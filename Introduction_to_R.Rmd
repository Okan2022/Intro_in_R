## 1. Welcome to this R Course

### 1.1 Let's start with a quick introduction round

-   Your Name
-   Your current study programme
-   Motivation for this course

### 1.2 Prerequisities

- `R` and RStudio 
- Access to Ilias 

### What is `R` and `RStudio`

`R` is a programming language specifically developed for statistical analysis. `RStudio` is a nice graphical interface to work with R. 

### 1.3 Why `R` ? 

+ Free of cost and open-source 
+ Functionalities for all steps of research process from Data Collection to
Data Analysis
+ Programming language specifically developed for statistical analysis 
+ Very active Community: 
 + e.g. `R` community on [StackOverflow] (https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/)
 + e.g. *#rstats* on twitter

### 1.4 What expects you and what not 

In this course you will learn: 

+ To get familiar with `R` and its basic language 
+ Core commands from the tidyverse package 
+ Data Wrangling, Data Bridging, Data Munging, Data Manipulation 
+ An efficient Workflow 
+ A brief introduction into core Datasets of Political Science 

You will **not** learn: 

+ Data Analysis (QM and AQM) 
+ Advanced R usage (Webscraping, Quantitative Text Analysis etc...)  

### 1.5 Overview of the course structure: 

**1. The R enviornment** 

 + Basic Functionality (Calculations, Vectors, Matrices, Lists)
 + Object classes 
 + Accessing, Subsetting and Naming Objects
 
**2. Data Manipulation** 

 + Pipelines or Piping 
 + The tidyverse - Dplyr 
 + Loading and Storing Data 
 + Ordering your Data: Renaming, Re-Ordering, Subsetting and Selecting 
 + Transforming Variables 
 + Merging Data 
 + Missing Values 
 
**3. Exploratory Data Analysis/Descriptives** 

 + Summary Statistics - the Psych package 
 + Frequency Tables 
 + Cross-Tabulations, Correlation Matrice 
 
**4. Data Visualization** 

 + The Tidyverse - ggplot 2 
 + Constructing Plots 
 + Plotting anything 

**5. R Programming** 

 + For Loops 
 + Functions




## 2. Getting familiar with RStudio and establishing a Workflow 

### 2.1 The user interface 

RStudio has four main components and each of them has a purpose: 

![**Figure 1: Standard RStudio Interface**](images/example1.jpeg)



+ **On the top left** you can see the **Source** window. In this window you write and run your code. The console opens after you choose, which type of Script you want to use: 

 + The standard **R Script** (`Ctrl + Shift + N`): In this file you can just write your code and run it. You can also make commenting lines with putting a `#` in front of it. 
 
 + The **R Markdown File**: In contrast to the standard **R Script** not everything written in a **R Markdown File** is automatically considered as Code (if not written after an `#`). A **R Markdown File** has options to design an HTML Output and a PDF Output. This can increase your efficiency in terms of working with partners. Further, you can write your code in **chunks** and have plenty options to work with those **chunks**.
 In QM and AQM you will exclusively use **R Markdown** and over time you will see the advantages of R Markdown.
 

+ **On the top right** you can see the **Environment**. Here you have an overview over all the objects currently loaded in your environment. You will learn more about objects later in the course.
 
+ **On the bottom left** you have the **Console**: This is where the results appear once you execute your R-code. You can also directly type R-code into the console and execute it. However, we cannot save this code which is why we usually work in the Editor.

+ **On the bottom right** you can see the **Output**: Plots (if you use the standard R Script) and other things will appear here, don't worry too much about it for the moment.


### 2.2 How to design it according to your preferences 

+ You can change the appearance of `RStudio`: `Tools > Global Options > Appearance`. Here you can change the zoom of the Console, the font size of the your letters and the style of your code. Further, you can change RStudio to a dark theme. Play around with it and find out how it is the most comfortable for you and of course you can change it over time.

+ You can change the **Pane Layout** meaning where the four components of RStudio should be: `RStudio`: `Tools > Global Options > Pane Layout`. 

+ You should use key shortcuts. There are pre-installed short-cuts of RStudio, which are really helpful. You should get familiar with them. `Tools > Key Shortcut Helps` or directly with `Ctrl + Shift + K`. You can add your own Key Shortcuts and we will do that in this course.  

### 2.3 R Projects 

+ A **R project** is a efficient way of storing your code, files and data. It makes it easier to work with others (especially when using GitHub). It makes things easier. When you open a file, you should always first open the **R project** and then in your **Output**, in **Files** your script. Also for cooperation it is advantageous, because **R projects** include everything necessary to replicate the R file. 



## 3. Lets get started: R as a fancy calculator 

```{r}

#You can use hashtags to comment

1 + 1 #Addition

1 - 1 #Substraction

1 * 1 #Multiplication 

1 / 1 #Division

2^(1 / 2) #Mixed Terms

```
